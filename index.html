            <p>
                Hello everyone! My name is Efrain Tinoco. Professionally, I have over 20 years of experience with
                Ford Motor Credit. I currently supervise a diverse team of 12 CSR’s,
                which I help train and motivate towards individual and group goals.
                I ensure daily tasks and functions are completed accurately, timely, and per
                Company Policy and Procedure. I am a self-starter, and detailed oriented,
                with great written and verbal communications skills. <br> <br>
                Personally, I am married to a beautiful wife and I'm a father of two
                wonderful teenagers. I was born and raised in Dallas, TX, which explains why I am the biggest Dallas
                Cowboys
                fan you will
                ever meet! I am of Mexican-American descent, and I am
                very proud of my culture. As
                such, I make it a point to celebrate <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/halloween/day-of-the-dead"
                    target="_blank"><em> Day of the Dead</em></a>
                every year, which is one of the most important holidays in the Latino community.
                <br><br>
            </p>

            <h2><em> Aspiring Software Engineer ! </h2></em>
            <p>
                I’m Interested in a career as a software engineer,
                because of the long-term outlook that being a software engineer
                presents within the company.
                As the company continues to evolve and places an emphasis on
                “Modernizing Everywhere”, I know software engineering will be in high demand, which
                can potentially open up a completely different career path for me,
                while remaining at Ford Credit. Having worked here for over 20 years, I have
                been exploring different options, within the company, that can help me expand
                my knowledge and contribute to the team in a different way. I think the Learn
                to Code program does just that and is a perfect fit for me!
