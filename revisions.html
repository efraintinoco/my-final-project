                        alt="Webpage before feedback"></a>

                For the feedback, I asked two of my teammates, Jose Gonzalez and Nicole Robinson, if they could review
                the
                first draft of my website and provide me feedback.
                They are both also supervisors in the CSC Department at Ford Credit, and I have worked with them for over
                15 years each. We have worked together on several
                different projects, and we have always been able to provide each other open and honest feedback. To the
                left you will see what my website looked prior to the revisions. They provided several suggestions,
                which are listed below. <br><br>


            <Div> <br>
                <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;"> Suggestions made</h2>
                <Div> <br>
                    <ul class="ul" style="display: inline-block; text-align:left">
                        <li>Website looks plain and looks like a Word document</li>
                        <li> Font was small and should be changed </li>
                        <li> Space needed between text and images</li>
                        <li> Navigation menu did not look good on the left side of page</li>






                    </ul>
                    </p>

                        style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;  " width="15%" alt="Webpage after feedback"></a>

                To the right, you will see what my website looks like now, after the feedback provided was implemented.
                The focal point of the feedback
                provided was that my site, although well done, looked plain and too much like a Word document. I ended
                up redoing almost the entire styling,
                and adding several different sections and background images to give it a more polished and professional
                look. I'm glad my peers provided me
                the feedback, because it helped me better my project and think outside the box. It also helped me learn
                a few things about HTML and CSS along the way. Below you will see a list of the revisions made to my
                page, which I believe made it better overall.

                        <li> Changed font and made it bigger</li>
                        <li> Added padding between text and images </li>
                        <li> Centered navigation menu on page</li>
