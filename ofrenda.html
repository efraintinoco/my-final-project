            <h1><em> "Ofrenda"</h1></em>
            <p>
                Day of the Dead is a tradition that goes back thousands of years. It goes all the way back to the
                Mesoamerican civilizations of
                Central and Southern Mexico. The centerpiece of Day of the Dead is known as an
                <em>"ofrenda"</em>. An ofrenda, which may be quite large and elaborate, is usually created by the family
                members of a person who has
                died and is intended to welcome the deceased family member to the home. I take great joy in
                putting together an ofrenda every year. Ofrendas are not only a great way to honor the dead, but putting
                one together is also a great bonding
                experience for the entire family ! For images and information on ofrendas please <i><a

            <p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 10px;">

                <a href="images/ofrenda.png"> <img src="images/ofrenda.png" border="2" width="20%" alt="Ofrenda at home"

                <strong>The Bottom Tier</strong> is the most practical. This is filled with candles, to light the way,
                and also
                water so the returning souls can
                refresh themselves from the long journey. This tier, at times, may also include a basin and razor for
                washing and grooming upon
                arrival. The candles may also be decorated with pictures and embellisments.This is where you also find
                the Marigold flowers, as they
                are said to help lead the departed souls home.

            </p>

            <p style="text-align: center;">

                <strong>The Second Tier</strong> is used to place items such as food, drinks, and personal belongings
                for
                the returning souls.
                This tier includes traditional foods such as tamales, sugarcane, fruit, and
                <a href="https://www.bhg.com/recipes/ethnic-food/mexican/what-is-pan-de-muerto/" target="_blank"><em>pan
                        de muertos.</em></a> For ofrendas calling on
                deceased adults, servings of tequila or beer are common. For children, their favorite toy is usually
                included in the display.

                <strong>The Top Tier</strong> is used to identify the person (or persons) for whom the ofrenda was
                created. Here you will find several photographs
                of when they were alive, sitting on the top tier along with various religious items. This is also where
                you will find the sugar skulls.
                Sugar skulls, which represent the departed souls, also reflect the traditional folk art style, with big
                happy smiles and
                colorful icing decorations. Making the sugar skulls are a great
                family bonding experience. Try it for yourself !
